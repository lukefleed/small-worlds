    "Given a social network, which of its nodes are more central? This question has been asked many times in sociology, psychology and computer science, and a whole plethora of centrality measures (a.k.a. centrality indices, or rankings) were proposed to account for the importance of the nodes of a network. \n",
    "\n",
    "These networks, typically generated directly or indirectly by human activity and interaction (and therefore hereafter dubbed social”), appear in a large variety of contexts and often exhibit a surprisingly similar structure. One of the most important notions that researchers have been trying to capture in such networks is “node centrality”: ideally, every node (often representing an individual) has some degree of influence or importance within the social domain under  consideration, and one expects such importance to surface in the structure of the social network; centrality is a quantitative measure that aims at revealing the importance of a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the types of centrality that have been considered in the literature, many have to do with distances between nodes. Take, for instance, a node in an undirected connected network: if the sum of distances to all other nodes is large, the node under consideration is peripheral; this is the starting point to define Bavelas's closeness centrality \\cite{closeness}, which is the reciprocal of peripherality (i.e., the reciprocal of the sum of distances to all other nodes). \n",
    "\n",
    "The role played by shortest paths is justified by one of the most well-known features of complex networks, the so-called small-world phenomenon. A small-world network is a graph where the average distance between nodes is logarithmic in the size of the network, whereas the clustering coefficient is larger (that is, neighborhoods tend to be denser) than in a random Erdős-Rényi graph with the same size and average distance. The fact that social networks (whether electronically mediated or not) exhibit the small-world property is known at least since Milgram's famous experiment and is arguably the most popular of all features of complex networks. For instance, the average distance of the Facebook graph was recently established to be just $4.74$.\n"

    "# The Erdős-Rényi model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before 1960, graph theory mainly dealt with the properties of specific individual graphs. In the 1960s, Paul Erdős and Alfred Rényi initiated a systematic study of random graphs. Random graph theory is, in fact, not the study of individual graphs, but the study of a statistical ensemble of graphs (or, as mathematicians prefer to call it, a \\emph{probability space} of graphs). The ensemble is a class consisting of many different graphs, where each graph has a probability attached to it. A property studied is said to exist with probability $P$ if the total probability of a graph in the ensemble possessing that property is $P$ (or the total fraction of graphs in the ensemble that has this property is $P$). This approach allows the use of probability theory in conjunction with discrete mathematics for studying graph ensembles.  A property is said to exist for a class of graphs if the fraction of graphs in the ensemble which does not have this property is of zero measure. This is usually termed as a property of \\emph{almost every (a.e.)} graph. Sometimes the terms “almost surely” or “with high probability” are also used (with the former usually taken to mean that the residual probability vanishes exponentially with the system size). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Erdős-Rényi graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Two well-studied graph ensembles are $G_{N,M}$, the ensemble of all graphs with $N$ nodes and $M$ edges, and $G_{N,p}$, the ensemble of all graphs with $N$ nodes and probability $p$ of any two nodes being connected. These two families, initially studied by Erdős and Rényi, are known to be similar if $M = \\binom{N}{2} p$, so as long $p$ is not too close to $0$ or $1$ they are referred to as ER graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important attribute of a graph is the average degree, i.e., the average number of edges connected to each node. We will denote the degree of the ith node by $k_i$ and the average degree by $ \\langle r \\rangle $ . $N$-vertex graphs with $\\langle k \\rangle = O(N^0)$ are called sparse graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting characteristic of the ensemble $G_{N,p}$ is that many of its properties have a related threshold function, $p_t(N)$, such that the property exists, in the “thermodynamic limit” of $N \\to \\infty$  with probability 0 if $p < p_t$ , and with probability $1$ if $p > p_t$ . This phenomenon is the same as the physical concept of a percolation phase transition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another property is the average path length between any two nodes, which in almost every graph of the ensemble (with $\\langle k \\rangle > 1$ and finite) is of order $\\ln N$ . The small, logarithmic distance is actually the origin of the “small-world” phenomena that characterize networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scale-free networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The Erdős-Rényi model has traditionally been the dominant subject of study in the field of random graphs. Recently, however, several studies of real-world networks have found that the ER model fails to reproduce many of their observed properties. One of the simplest properties of a network that can be measured directly is the degree distribution, or the fraction P(k) of nodes having k connections (degree $k$). A well-known result for ER networks is that the degree distribution is Poissonian,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    P(k) = \\frac{e^{z} z^k}{k!}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $z = \\langle k \\rangle$. is the average degree.  Direct measurements of the degree distribution for real networks show that the Poisson law does not apply. Rather, often these nets exhibit a scale-free degree distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    P(k) = ck^{-\\gamma} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad k = m, ... , K\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $c \\sim (\\gamma -1)m^{\\gamma - 1}$ is a normalization factor, and $m$ and $K$ are the lower and upper cutoffs for the degree of a node, respectively. The divergence of moments higher then $\\lceil \\gamma -1 \\rceil$ (as  $K \\to \\infty$ when $N \\to \\infty$) is responsible for many of the anomalous properties attributed to scale-free networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "All real-world networks are finite and therefore all their moments are finite. The actual value of the cutoff K plays an important role. It may be approximated by noting that the total probability of nodes with $k > K$ is of order $1/N$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\int_K^\\infty P(k) dk \\sim \\frac{1}{N}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields the result\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    K \\sim m N^{1/(\\gamma -1)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree distribution alone is not enough to characterize the network. There are many other quantities, such as the degree-degree correlation (between connected nodes), the spatial correlations, the clustering coefficient, the betweenness or central-ity distribution, and the self-similarity exponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Diameter and fractal dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular lattices can be viewed as networks embedded in Euclidean space, of a well-defined dimension, $d$. This means that $n(r)$, the number of nodes within a distance $r$ from an origin, grows as $n(r) \\sim r^d$ (for large $r$). For fractal objects, $d$ in the last relation may be a non-integer and is replaced by the fractal dimension $d_f$ \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a network where the above power laws are not valid is the Cayley tree (also known as the Bethe lattice). The Cayley tree is a regular graph, of fixed degree $z$, and no loops. An infinite Cayley tree cannot be embedded in a Euclidean space of finite dimensionality. The number of nodes at $l$ is $n(l) \\sim (z - 1)^l$ . Since the exponential growth is faster than any power law, Cayley trees are referred to as infinite-dimensional systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most random network models, the structure is locally tree-like (since most loops occur only for $n(l) \\sim N$), and since the number of nodes grows as $n(l) \\sim \\langle k - 1 \\rangle^l$, they are also infinite dimensional. As a consequence, the diameter of such graphs (i.e., the minimal path between the most distant nodes) scales as $D \\sim \\ln N$. Many properties of ER networks, including the logarithmic diameter, are also present in Cayley trees. This small diameter in ER graphs and Cayley trees is in contrast to that of finite-dimensional lattices, where $D \\sim N^{1/d_l}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to ER, percolation on infinite-dimensional lattices and the Cayley tree  yields a critical threshold $p_c = 1/(z - 1)$. For $p > p_c$, a “giant cluster” of order $N$ exists, whereas for $p < pc$,only small clusters appear. For infinite-dimensional lattices (similar to ER networks) at criticality, $p =\n",
    "p_c$ , the giant component is of size $N^{2/3}$. This last result follows from the fact that percolation on lattices in dimension $d \\geq d_c = 6$ is in the same universality class as infinite-dimensional percolation, where the fractal dimension of the giant cluster is $d_f = 4$, and therefore the size of the giant cluster scales as $N^{d_f/d_c} = N^{2/3}$. The dimension $d_c$ is called the “upper critical dimension.” Such an upper critical dimension exists not only in percolation phenomena, but also in other physical models, such as in the self-avoiding walk model for polymers and in the Ising model for magnetism; in both these cases $d_c = 4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watts and Strogatz suggested a model that retains the local high clustering of lattices (i.e., the neighbors of a node have a much higher probability of being neighbors than in random graphs) while reducing the diameter to $D \\sim \\ln N$ . This so-called, “small-world network” is achieved by replacing a fraction $\\varphi$ of the links in a regular lattice with random links, to random distant neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Random graphs as a model of real networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Many natural and man-made systems are networks, i.e., they consist of objects and interactions between them. These include computer networks, in particular the Internet, logical networks, such as links between WWW pages, and email networks, where a link represents the presence of a person's address in another person's address book. Social interactions in populations, work relations, etc. can also be modeled by a network structure. Networks can also describe possible actions or movements of a system in a configuration space (a phase space), and the nearest configurations are connected by a link. All the above examples and many others have a graph structure that can be studied. Many of them have some ordered structure, derived from geographical or geometrical considerations, cluster and group formation, or other specific properties.  However, most of the above networks are far from regular lattices and are much more complex and random in structure. Therefore, it can be assumed (with a lot of precaution) that they maintain many properties of the appropriate random graph model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many aspects scale-free networks can be regarded as a generalization of ER networks. For large $\\gamma$ (usually, for $\\gamma > 4$) the properties of scale-free networks, such as distances, optimal paths, and percolation, are the same as in ER networks. In contrast, for $\\gamma < 4$, these properties are very different and can be regarded as anomalous. The anomalous behavior of scale-free networks is due to the strong heterogeneity in the degree of the nodes, which breaks the node-to-node translational homogeneity (symmetry) that exists in the classical\n",
    "homogeneous networks, such as lattices, Cayley trees, and ER graphs. The small variation of the degrees in the ER model or in scale-free networks with large $gamma$ is insufficient to break this symmetry, and therefore many results for ER networks are the same as for Cayley trees, where the degree of each node is the same.\n",

    "Given a social network, which of its nodes are more central? This question has been asked many times in sociology, psychology and computer science, and a whole plethora of centrality measures (a.k.a. centrality indices, or rankings) were proposed to account for the importance of the nodes of a network. \n",
    "\n",
    "These networks, typically generated directly or indirectly by human activity and interaction (and therefore hereafter dubbed \"social\"), appear in a large variety of contexts and often exhibit a surprisingly similar structure. One of the most important notions that researchers have been trying to capture in such networks is “node centrality”: ideally, every node (often representing an individual) has some degree of influence or importance within the social domain under  consideration, and one expects such importance to surface in the structure of the social network; centrality is a quantitative measure that aims at revealing the importance of a node. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the types of centrality that have been considered in the literature, many have to do with distances between nodes. Take, for instance, a node in an undirected connected network: if the sum of distances to all other nodes is large, the node under consideration is peripheral; this is the starting point to define Bavelas's closeness centrality, which is the reciprocal of peripherality (i.e., the reciprocal of the sum of distances to all other nodes). \n",
    "\n",
    "The role played by shortest paths is justified by one of the most well-known features of complex networks, the so-called **small-world phenomenon**. A small-world network is a graph where the average distance between nodes is logarithmic in the size of the network, whereas the clustering coefficient is larger (that is, neighborhoods tend to be denser) than in a random Erdős-Rényi graph with the same size and average distance. The fact that social networks (whether electronically mediated or not) exhibit the small-world property is known at least since Milgram's famous experiment and is arguably the most popular of all features of complex networks. For instance, the average distance of the Facebook graph was recently established to be just $4.74$ \n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1998 Watts and Strogatz proposed a simple model for generating networks with the small-world property. The model is based on a regular lattice of $N$ nodes, where each node is connected to its $k$ nearest neighbors. The model then proceeds as follows: for each edge, the probability $p$ of rewiring it is considered. If the edge is rewired, it is replaced by a random edge with uniform probability. The resulting network is a small-world network with $N$ nodes, $k$ nearest neighbors, and average distance $\\log(N)/\\log(k)$. -->"

In fact, in networks with no weight (i.e., where all edges have the same length), there might be more than one shortest path. In that case, it is common to take $g_i(j, k) = C_i(j,k)/C(j,k)$, where $C(j,k)$ is the number of shortest paths between $j$ and $k$, and $C_i(j,k)$ is the number of those going through $i$. \\footnote{Several variations of this scheme exist, focusing, in particular, on how to count distinct shortest paths (if several shortest paths share some edges). These differences tend to have a very small statistical influence in random complex networks, where the number of short loops is small. Therefore, we will concentrate on the above definition. Another nuance is whether the source and destination are considered part of the shortest path.\n",

    "<!-- ## The Small-World Model\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be clarified that real networks are not random. Their formation and development are dictated by a combination of many different processes and influences. These influencing conditions include natural limitations and processes, human considerations such as optimal performance and robustness, economic considerations, natural selection and many others. Controversies still exist regarding the measure to which random models represent real-world networks. However, in this chapter we will focus on random network models and attempt to show if their properties may still be used to study properties of real-world networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-world networks have many properties that cannot be explained by the ER model. One such property is the high clustering observed in many real-world networks. This led Watts and Strogatz to develop an alternative model, called the “small-world” model. Their idea was to begin with an ordered lattice, such as the \\emph{k-}ring (a ring where each site is connected to its $2k$ nearest neighbors - k from each side) or the two-dimensional lattice. For each site, each of the links emanating from it is removed with probability $\\varphi$ and is rewired to a randomly selected site in the network. A variant of this process is to add links rather than rewire, which simplifies the analysis without considerably affecting the results. The obtained network has the desirable properties of both an ordered lattice (large clustering) and a random network (small world), as we will discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering in a small-world network\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to treat clustering analytically in a small-world network is to use the link addition, rather than the rewiring model. In the limit of large network size, $N \\to \\infty$, and for a fixed fraction of shortcuts $\\phi$, it is clear that the probability of forming triangle vanishes as we approach $1/N$, so the contribution of the shortcuts to the clustering is negligible. Therefore, the clustering of a small-world network is determined by its underlying ordered lattice. For example, consider a ring where each node is connected to its $k$ closest neighbors from each side. A node's number of neighbors is therefore $2k$, and thus it has $2k(2k - 1)/2 = k(2k - 1)$ pairs of neighbors. Consider a node, $i$. All of the $k$ nearest nodes on $i$'s left are connected to each other, and the same is true for the nodes on $i$'s right. This amounts to $2k(k - 1)/2 = k(k - 1)$ pairs. Now consider a node located $d$ places to the left of $k$. It is also connected to its $k$ nearest neighbors from each side. Therefore, it will be connected to $k - d$ neighbors on $i$'s right side. The total number of connected neighbor pairs is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    k(k-1) + \\sum_{d=1}^k (k-d) = k(k-1) + \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} = \\frac{{3}{2}} k (k-1)\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For every $k > 1$, this results in a constant larger than $0$, indicating that the clustering of a small-world network does not vanish for large networks. For large values of $k$, the clustering coefficient approaches $3/4$, that is, the clustering is very high. Note that for a regular two-dimensional grid, the  clustering by definition is zero, since no triangles exist. However, it is clear that the grid has a neighborhood structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distances in a small-world network}\n",
    "\n",
    "The second important property of small-world networks is their small diameter, i.e., the small distance between nodes in the network. The distance in the underlying lattice behaves as the linear length of the lattice, L. Since $N \\sim L^d$  where $d$ is the lattice dimension, it follows that the distance between nodes behaves as:\n",

    "    l \\sim L \\sim N^{1/d}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "Therefore, the underlying lattice has a finite dimension, and the distances on it behave as a power law of the number of nodes, i.e., the distance between nodes is large. However, when adding even a small fraction of shortcuts to the network, this behavior changes dramatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to deduce the behavior of the average distance between nodes. Consider a small-world network, with dimension d and connecting distance $k$ (i.e., every node is connected to any other node whose distance from it in every linear dimension is at most $k$). Now, consider the nodes reachable from a source node with at most $r$ steps. When $r$ is small, these are just the \\emph{r-th} nearest neighbors of the source in the underlying lattice. We term the set of these neighbors a “patch”. the radius of which is $kr$ , and the number of nodes it contains is approximately $n(r) = (2kr)d$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We now want to find the distance r for which such a patch will contain about one shortcut. This will allow us to consider this patch as if it was a single node in a randomly connected network. Assume that the probability for a single node to have a shortcut is $\\Phi$. To find the length for which approximately one shortcut is encountered, we need to solve for $r$ the following equation: $(2kr)^d \\Phi = 1$. The correlation length $\\xi$ defined as the distance (or linear size of a patch) for which a shortcut will be encountered with high probability is therefore,\n",

Let us denote by $V(r)$ the total number of nodes reachable from a node by at most $r$ steps, and by $a(r)$, the number of nodes added to a patch in the \\emph{r-th} step. That is, $a(r) = n(r) - n(r-1)$. Thus,\n",

    "When a shortcut is encountered at the r step from a node, it leads to a new patch \\footnote{It may actually lead to an already encountered patch, and two patches may also merge after some steps, but this occurs with negligible probability when $N \\to \\infty$ until most of the network is reachable}. This new patch occurs after $r'$ steps, and therefore the number of nodes reachable from its origin is $V (r - r')$. Thus, we obtain the recursive relation\n",
